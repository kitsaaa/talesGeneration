# In this example, openai_api_wrapper, image_generation_api_wrapper, voice_synthesis_api_wrapper, 
# and video_editor_api_wrapper are placeholders for the actual API wrappers or libraries you'll use. You'll need to replace 
# them with the appropriate imports based on the APIs and libraries you choose.

# Also, the config module should contain the required API keys, parameters, and any other configuration settings 
# needed for each component.

# Keep in mind that this is just a basic outline to get you started. You'll need to build out the actual functions and
#  integrate the APIs and libraries you've chosen for each task. Additionally, you may need to handle errors and edge cases to
#   make the script more robust.
